## Assignment Description


## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Northern Pack CF App will be designed to support the TNPCF Non-Profit and it's members. Users will find useful that will give them ease of access to upcoming events as the Inter Miami soccer games, their membership cards and more information about TNPCF in general. The idea came from the need that I currently have the Agent Database in a Google Sheet and new members will out a google form to become members. 

### Features

- Membership Card: Users will have access to viewing their membership card through the click of a button.

- Admin Dashboard: There will be a dashboard for an admin to view all users as well as update membership cards.

Additional Features (if possible):
